1. Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that
   creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create
   the data). Write queries applying the following scenarios:
   a. Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
        SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name
        FROM booking
        RIGHT OUTER JOIN guest
        ON guest.id = booking.guest_id
        WHERE booking.guest_id IS NULL;

         first_name | last_name
        ------------+-----------
         Ed         | Hatton


   b. Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
        SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name, booking.check_in, booking.check_out, ARRAY_AGG(booking.room_id) AS rooms
        FROM booking
        JOIN guest
        ON guest.id = booking.guest_id
        GROUP BY guest.first_name, guest.last_name, booking.check_in, booking.check_out
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

         first_name | last_name |  check_in  | check_out  | rooms
        ------------+-----------+------------+------------+-------
         Kelly      | Renison   | 2018-02-01 | 2018-02-03 | {2,3}



   c. Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
        SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name, booking.room_id, booking.check_in, booking.check_out
        FROM booking
        JOIN guest
        ON booking.guest_id = guest.id
        JOIN (
        SELECT guest_id, room_id
        FROM booking
        GROUP BY guest_id, room_id
        HAVING COUNT(room_id) > 1) AS multiple
        ON booking.guest_id = multiple.guest_id
        AND booking.room_id = multiple.room_id;

         first_name | last_name | room_id |  check_in  | check_out
        ------------+-----------+---------+------------+------------
         Kelly      | Renison   |       3 | 2018-02-01 | 2018-02-03
         Kelly      | Renison   |       3 | 2017-11-01 | 2017-11-03
         Kelly      | Renison   |       3 | 2017-10-01 | 2016-10-03


   d. Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
        SELECT room_id, COUNT(DISTINCT guest_id) AS unique_guests
        FROM booking
        GROUP BY room_id;

         room_id | unique_guests
        ---------+---------------
               1 |             1
               2 |             2
               3 |             2



2. Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should
   include the students' grades for a given class.
   a. Work through the questions from the example above.

   b. Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data
      types should be used, etc., and include them in a text file.
          I need to store info about students, classes and grades. Students need at least
          a name(text) and id(integer). I also included a student email(text). Classes
          need at least a name(text) and id(integer). I also included a teacher. Grades
          need at lease an id(integer), student_id(integer), class_id(integer) and a
          grade(text).

          Classes can have many students
          Students can have many classes
          Students can have many grades but only one grade per class


   c. Ask questions of your mentor in your next session if you are unsure about parts
      of your model.

   d. Draw the model using the notation used in the checkpoint and submit a picture.
      You can also use a tool like StarUML or quickdatabasediagrams.com if you choose.

      The picture can be seen at the link below.

3. Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates
   the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data).
   Write queries for the following data:
   a. All students who have taken a particular class.
        SELECT student.name, class.name
        FROM grade
        JOIN student
        ON student.id = grade.student_id
        JOIN class
        ON class.id = grade.class_id
        WHERE class.name = 'Biology';

         name  |  name
        -------+---------
         Chris | Biology
         Sam   | Biology


   b. The number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.
        SELECT grade, COUNT(*)
        FROM grade
        WHERE class_id = 3
        GROUP BY grade;

         grade | count
        -------+-------
         A     |     2
         C     |     1

   c. Class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.
        SELECT class.name AS class, COUNT (DISTINCT student_id) AS number_of_students
        FROM grade
        JOIN class
        ON class.id = grade.class_id
        GROUP BY class.name;

          class  | number_of_students
        ---------+--------------------
         Algebra |                  3
         Biology |                  2
         History |                  3

   d. The class taken by the largest number of students.
        SELECT class.name AS class, COUNT(student_id) AS number_of_students
        FROM class
        JOIN grade
        ON class.id = grade.class_id
        GROUP BY class.name
        ORDER BY number_of_students DESC
        LIMIT 1;

          class  | number_of_students
        ---------+--------------------
         History |                  3
